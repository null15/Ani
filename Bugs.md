Current bugs:

-repick on red repicks blue hero
if blue -repick, then I can repick

if spam random button you get additional heroes

Its possible that, this variable:

let i=GetPlayerId(GetTriggerPlayer())+1

makes it from red to blue
and blue to teal, try having no red but blue and teal and let blue repick
